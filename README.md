# AnagrammTest

The Algorithm tests if two Words are an Anagramm of eachother like: Tokyo/Kyoto, Leben/Nebel(german) or Echse/Esche(german). Not John/Ion. You can execute the File without compiling if you use Java 9 or higher. The two Words(Strings) are turned into Lower Case only Strings. To equalize Lower-Case and Upper-Case Letters. And also i don't want to change the original Strings. Because thats a Side Effect. Then these altered Strings are turned into List of Char's. When sorted these two List's are exactly equal when the original Strings where Anagramms. That's Because the default (Java Comparator) comparison is defined like this.
