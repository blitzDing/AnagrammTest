# AnagrammTest

The Algorithm tests if two Words are an Anagramm of eachother like: Tokyo/Kyoto, Leben/Nebel(german) or Echse/Esche. Not John/Ion. You can execute 
the File without compiling if you use Java 9 or higher. The two Words(Strings) are turned into Lower Case only Strings. To equalize 
Lower-Case and Upper-Case Letters. And also i don't want to change the original Strings. Because thats a Side Effect. Then these altered 
Strings are turned into List of Char's. When sorted these two List's are exactly equal when the original Strings where Anagramms.
